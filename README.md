# Winnipeg 311 Calls Project
I used publicly available data on 311 calls (calls to city service for those unfamiliar) to gain insights into possible patterns of request for services.

# Purpose
Mainly to get better at using ggplot and creating visualizations in R. I used a specific program to project vector patterns into plot objects - something that would be useful in teaching settings (?) to create distinctive visualizations. Additionally, I used this opportunity to try my hand at creating dashboard visualizations using geographic data.

# Outcome
I created several correlation matrices and other visualizations. You can read about it on my Medium: https://medium.com/@kiernan.gange.
